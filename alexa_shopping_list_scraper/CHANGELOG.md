## 2.0.2 - FIX CHECKBOX CLICKING LOGIC

**Bug fixes:**
- **Fixed incomplete item completion** - Now properly clicks ALL items until the shopping list is completely empty
- **Improved checkbox clicking logic** - Repeatedly clicks the first (top) checkbox until all items are marked as completed
- **Added virtual list empty detection** - Stops clicking when the virtual list height becomes 0px
- **Enhanced safety mechanisms** - Added maximum attempt limit and better error handling to prevent infinite loops

**Technical improvements:**
- Replaced single-pass checkbox clicking with iterative approach
- Added proper DOM update waits between clicks
- Improved logging to show progress of item completion
- Better detection of when all items are completed
- **Cleaner, more concise logging** - Removed verbose debug messages, merged item listing and completion logs, added emojis to update messages

## 2.0.1 - CLEAN UP LOGGING AND MARK ITEMS AS COMPLETED

**Bug fixes:**
- Fixed duplicate [scrape] prefixes in logs
- Removed verbose 'exited with code 0' messages
- Removed JSON file mention from logs (kept for IPC)
- Removed debug screenshot/page source saving

**Feature improvements:**
- Renamed Delete_After_Download to Check_after_import
- Added functionality to mark items as completed on Amazon after import

## 2.0.0 - PYTHON-BASED REWRITE üêç

**BREAKING CHANGES:**
- **Removed cookie-based authentication entirely** - Only email/password + OTP authentication is now supported
- Simplified configuration - No more `Auth_Method`, `Cookies_JSON`, or `Cookies_Path` options
- **Stateless operation** - Each run performs fresh authentication without relying on persistent browser profiles

**Major improvements:**
- **üöÄ 5x faster execution** - Optimized all wait times and removed unnecessary page reloads
- **üéØ Superior bot detection bypass** - Python + undetected-chromedriver reliably bypasses Amazon's anti-automation
- **üîÑ Stateless design** - Fresh browser session every run, no session/cookie persistence between runs
- **üíª Automatic environment detection** - Works seamlessly in both Docker/Home Assistant and local development
- **üêõ Better error handling** - Detailed logging, error screenshots, and page source dumps for debugging

**Technical changes:**
- Migrated from Node.js/Puppeteer to Python/Selenium
- Uses undetected-chromedriver for reliable bot detection evasion
- Temporary Chrome profiles created and cleaned up each run
- Optimized login flow to avoid redundant page loads after OTP submission
- Improved scraping selectors for better reliability

## 1.2.2

- **Fix bot detection issues with comprehensive diagnostics**
  - Aggressive cookie/storage overrides to bypass Amazon's JavaScript checks
  - Comprehensive testing of `navigator.cookieEnabled`, `document.cookie`, localStorage, sessionStorage
  - Intelligent error diagnosis distinguishes cookie vs credential failures
  - Automatic cookie warning workaround with page reload
  - Full HTML dumps on error (debug mode)
  - Cookie file only written for cookie-based/auto authentication methods

## 1.2.1

- **improved scraping error logging and automatic retries**: no longer aborts on scrape failure but sleeps and retries; better error logging for item extraction

## 1.2.0

- **Dropped `Cookies_Path`; only use `Cookies_JSON`**: The Home Assistant add-on now accepts cookies only via the `Cookies_JSON` parameter. This simplifies configuration and avoids file path issues in containerized environments.
- **Removed `Cookies_Path` from config**: The option to use `Cookies_Path` is no longer available in the add-on configuration.

## 1.1.7

- **Bugfix for the case when website redirects to the login-page**: Added logic to detect whether the scraper is on the sign-in page after loading the shopping list URL. If so, authentication likely failed (cookies expired or invalid), and the script exits with an informative error message.

## 1.1.6

- **Added scraper user agent header and debugging improvements**: The scraper now sets a consistent user agent string (`'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/96.0.4664.45 Safari/537.36'`) to mimic a real browser. This helps avoid potential detection or issues with Amazon's server. Debug logging also includes more details about the HTTP requests, page navigation, and the final list of items found, making troubleshooting easier.

## 1.1.5

- **Enhanced debugging and dynamic wait**: Introduced an optional `Debug_Log` parameter (default: `false`). When enabled, the script runs in non-headless mode, takes screenshots at each login/navigation step, and enables verbose console/network logging in Chrome. Additionally, the scraper now waits for the shopping list items to appear on the page (using `waitForSelector`) instead of relying solely on a fixed timeout, improving reliability.

## 1.1.4

- **Interactive Login and OTP support**: The scraper now supports logging into your Amazon account using email and password (with optional OTP).  
  If no valid cookies are provided, it navigates to the Amazon sign-in page, prompts you to enter credentials (and OTP if required), and then proceeds to scrape the shopping list. This makes the add-on more flexible and easier to use without having to manually extract cookies every time they expire.

## 1.1.3

- **Multiple Ways to Provide Cookies & Automatic Fallback**: You can now use either `Cookies_Path` or `Cookies_JSON` in the add-on configuration. If both are set, `Cookies_JSON` takes precedence. This gives you more flexibility in how you manage session cookies.

## 1.1.2

- **Automatic Retry on Cookies Expired**: No longer crashes if cookies expire. Instead, the script logs an error and waits for the next polling cycle, allowing you time to update the cookies without restarting the add-on.

## 1.1.1

- **Added CHANGELOG**: Introduced this file to keep track of changes across versions.

## 1.1.0

- **Initial stable release with cookie-based authentication**: Uses Puppeteer to navigate to the Amazon Alexa Shopping List page with cookies exported from the user's browser. Scrapes list items and sends them to a Home Assistant webhook.

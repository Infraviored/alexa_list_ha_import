# Amazon Shopping List Scraper
** This project is based on (https://github.com/jtbnz/amazon_shopping_list/) by https://github.com/jtbnz **

The project scrapes the Amazon Shopping List page and add the items to the Home Assistant Shopping List (todo list) every 3 minutes.
* This is a one-way sync only from Amazon List to Home Assistant and it only adds item to Home Assistant. It does not remove items from Home Assistant (even if removed from Amazon Shopping List)
* This project was crerated using the Amazon USA pages. If you are using amazon in a different location, change the URLs in the Configuration Section.

### Important - Do not skip this step<BR>
You will need the Amazon Email and Password that you use to Login, the OTP Secret Key and the Home Assistant Webhook URL.

### Extra - Clear Alexa Shopping List
Because this is a one way sync (from Amazon Shopping List to Home Assistant), I have an automation that clear Amazon Shopping list every night at midnight.
Here is the Automation in YAML:

```
description: ""
mode: single
trigger:
  - platform: time
    at: "00:00:00"
condition: []
action:
  - service: media_player.volume_set
    data:
      volume_level: 0.01
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.my_alexa
  - delay:
      hours: 0
      minutes: 0
      seconds: 3
      milliseconds: 0
  - service: media_player.play_media
    data:
      media_content_type: custom
      media_content_id: "clear my shopping list"
      enqueue: play
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.my_alexa
    enabled: true
  - delay:
      hours: 0
      minutes: 0
      seconds: 3
      milliseconds: 0
    enabled: true
  - service: media_player.play_media
    data:
      media_content_type: custom
      media_content_id: "yes"
      enqueue: play
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.my_alexa
    enabled: true
```

### Extra - Debug Option
Enable the option "Debug_Log"
It will generate verbose logs for several calls inside the script.
Once the Add-On completes a full cycle of running=> error=> running again, some screenshots of the process internally, can be found at http://homeassistant.local:8888
